For examples see:\n *\n * - [wu.js](http://fitzgen.github.io/wu.js/)\n * - [Linq.js](http://linqjs.codeplex.com/)\n * - [from.js](https://github.com/suckgamoni/fromjs/)\n * - [IxJS](http://rx.codeplex.com/)\n * - [sloth.js](http://rfw.name/sloth.js/)\n *\n * However, at least at present, Lazy.js is faster (on average) than any of\n * those libraries. It is also more complete, with nearly all of the\n * functionality of [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/) and\n * [Lo-Dash](http://lodash.com/).\n *\n * Finding your way around the code\n * --------------------------------\n *\n * At the heart of Lazy.js is the {@link Sequence} object. You create an initial\n * sequence using {@link Lazy}, which can accept an array, object, or string.\n * You can then \"chain\" together methods from this sequence, creating a new\n * sequence with each call.\n *\n * Here's an example:\n *\n *     var data = getReallyBigArray();\n *\n *     var statistics = Lazy(data)\n *       .map(transform)\n *       .filter(validate)\n *       .reduce(aggregate);\n *\n * {@link Sequence} is the foundation of other, more specific sequence types.\n *\n * An {@link ArrayLikeSequence} provides indexed access to its elements.\n *\n * An {@link ObjectLikeSequence} consists of key/value pairs.\n *\n * A {@link StringLikeSequence} is like a string (duh): actually, it is an\n * {@link ArrayLikeSequence} whose elements happen to be characters.\n *\n * An {@link AsyncSequence} is special: it iterates over its elements\n * asynchronously (so calling `each` generally begins an asynchronous loop and\n * returns immediately).\n *\n * For more information\n * --------------------\n *\n * I wrote a blog post that explains a little bit more about Lazy.js, which you\n * can read [here](http://philosopherdeveloper.com/posts/introducing-lazy-js.html).\n *\n * You can also [create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/dtao/lazy.js/issues)\n * if you have any issues with the library. I work through them eventually.\n *\n * [@dtao](https://github.com/dtao)\n */\n\n(function(root, factory) {\n  if (typeof define === 'function' && define.amd) {\n    define(factory);\n  } else if (typeof exports === 'object') {\n    module.exports = factory();\n  } else {\n    root.Lazy = factory();\n  }\n})(this, function(context) {\n  /**\n   * Wraps an object and returns a {@link Sequence}.

Pass a *method name* and an object containing *function overrides* to\n   *    {@link Sequence.define}. If the object includes a function called `init`,\n   *    this function will be called upon initialization.\n   * 2. The object should include at least either a `getIterator` method or an\n   *    `each` method. The former supports both asynchronous and synchronous\n   *    iteration, but is slightly more cumbersome to implement. The latter\n   *    supports synchronous iteration and can be automatically implemented in\n   *    terms of the former.

For more info, see {@link Iterator} and\n   *    {@link AsyncSequence}.\n   *\n   * As a trivial example, the following code defines a new method, `sample`,\n   * which randomly may or may not include each element from its parent.\n   *\n   *     Lazy.Sequence.define(\"sample\", {\n   *       each: function(fn) {\n   *         return this.parent.each(function(e) {\n   *           // 50/50 chance of including this element.\n   *           if (Math.random() > 0.5) {\n   *             return fn(e);\n   *           }\n   *         });\n   *       }\n   *     });\n   *\n   * (Of course, the above could also easily have been implemented using\n   * {@link #filter} instead of creating a custom sequence.

You just have a couple more methods you need to\n   * implement: `get` and (optionally) `length`.\n   *\n   * Here's an example. Let's define a sequence type called `OffsetSequence` that\n   * offsets each of its parent's elements by a set distance, and circles back to\n   * the beginning after reaching the end. **Remember**: the initialization\n   * function you pass to {@link #define} should always accept a `parent` as its\n   * first parameter.\n   *\n   *     ArrayLikeSequence.define(\"offset\", {\n   *       init: function(parent, offset) {\n   *         this.offset = offset;\n   *       },\n   *\n   *       get: function(i) {\n   *         return this.parent.get((i + this.offset) % this.parent.length());\n   *       }\n   *     });\n   *\n   * It's worth noting a couple of things here.\n   *\n   * First, Lazy's default implementation of `length` simply returns the parent's\n   * length. In this case, since an `OffsetSequence` will always have the same\n   * number of elements as its parent, that implementation is fine; so we don't\n   * need to override it.\n   *\n   * Second, the default implementation of `each` uses `get` and `length` to\n   * essentially create a `for` loop, which is fine here. If you want to implement\n   * `each` your own way, you can do that; but in most cases (as here), you can\n   * probably just stick with the default.\n   *\n   * So we're already done, after only implementing `get`!
